#### SUMMARY
The purpose of this exploration is to identify potential sources of bias in a corpus of human-annotated data, and describe some implications of those biases. Specifically, this analysis attempts to answer the question, "How consistent are the labeling behaviors among workers with different demographic profiles?" in regards to two separate Wikimedia datasets:

1. Toxicity
2. Aggression

Each of these datasets cover 100k talk page diffs (with 10 judgements per diff).

#### FINAL PRODUCT
